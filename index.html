        <em>I`m Michal Figiel, and I`m a material science engineer</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>Science was always more than information I had to remember. Learning something new or practicing knowledge
        in live action is what drives me. At the beginning of my professional life, I was involved in metalworking due
        to my vocational education. The machines I operated used CNC control
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the job market situation in the 90s and the intense recruitment for compulsory military service, I
        continued my education while simultaneously working in the home renovations industry. After my studies, I took a
        job in the refrigeration industry as a technical and sales advisor..

      <p>
        <b>In 2004</b>
        <i>I emigrated to Ireland,</i> where for the 8 years I had my own bathroom refurbishment company.
        <span class="ciekawyElement">When I returned to Poland I started working as Office Manager for thermo solar
          company</span>
        which lead me to becoming a Sales Manager for British heat exchanger company.
        <strong>From 2013 I was responsible for Quality Management at </strong>
        factory manufacturing architectural lighting.

    <div class="box2">
      Unfortunately for me, Poland was not ready to follow in the footsteps of countries like Norway or the Netherlands,
      and soon I realized that it is very difficult to sell in such an environment, so I returned to the building industry.
      <hr>
      Since 2021, I have been based in Denmark, but the outcome of this endeavor remains to be seen.
